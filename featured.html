                Embark on a sonic voyage with Andre 3000's groundbreaking album, "New Blue Sun." Experience a blend of innovation and artistry that redefines musical boundaries, offering a celestial experience for the ears and soul.
                <br> <br>
                A departure album in the classic sense, New Blue Sun also feels like André has arrived. Its making came about organically, once he relocated from New York to LA. Instead of the OutKast origin story that started at Headland and Delowe, where Big Boi and Dre met their future Dungeon Family producers Organized Noize back in the day, this remix began with an unassuming trip to Erewhon — the chic LA health food chain where André bumped into percussionist and experimental jazz heavy, Carlos Niño.
